# PlantsDiseasesPredection-Identification
## Abstract 
Plant disease prediction and identification are important tasks in agriculture as they can help
farmers take timely action to prevent crop losses. In this thesis, we investigated the use of
machine learning and deep learning techniques for these purposes. We began by reviewing the
fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning, with a specific focus on their application
to plant disease prediction.
The study then presents a case study where we utilized machine learning and deep learning
techniques to predict the risk of plant disease in tomato crops and identify plant diseases based
on leaf images. For the experiments, we used two different datasets. In the first experiment, we
employed structured data to train three models: logistic regression, an artificial neural network
(ANN), and a support vector machine (SVM). In the second experiment, we used unstructured
data to train convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures VGG16 and MobileNetV1.
The results of the case study indicate that the ANN model achieved the best performance in
terms of accuracy and F1-score. The ANN model correctly predicted the risk of disease in
97% of the test data. Additionally, the CNN architecture called MobileNetV1 demonstrated
an impressive accuracy of 98% in the plant leaf disease identification task.
Based on the results of the case study, we conclude that machine learning and deep learning
techniques can be effectively utilized for plant disease prediction and identification. These
methods offer promising avenues for assisting farmers in safeguarding their crops and enhancing
agricultural productivity.
